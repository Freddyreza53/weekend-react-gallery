# Gallery of My Life

## Description

Gallery of My Life allows the user to see pictures that have been taken of my dog, my wife, and myself. There is a total of 9 pictures and you can cycle through them by clicking on the 'Next Picture' or 'Prev Picture' buttons. The user is able to click directly on the picture to toggle between the picture and a short description of each picture. Below the picture, there is a 'Likes' counter that can be used to keep track how many likes a picture receives. To add to the 'Like' counter, the user must click on the 'I Love It!' button beneath the counter. Finally, the user is able to keep track of which picture is currently being displayed by looking at the counter at the bottom of the screen.

## Installation

1. Create database named "photo_library"
2. The queries in the database.sql file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. The project is built on Postgres, so you will need to make sure to have that installed. We recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries,
3. Open up your editor of choice and run an 'npm install'.
4. Use 'npm run server' in one terminal.
5. Use 'npm run client' in another terminal.
6. Open browser and visit localhost:3000 to use site.
